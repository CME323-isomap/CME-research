\section{Classification}

\vspace{5 mm}
\noindent
For a classification problem, we are given a dataset of size $N$ where each 
data point falls into one of $C$ classes. Each data point contains $P$ features. 
For simplicity, we will assume that each feature is a continuous real number. 
We believe that each class $C$ will appear in clusters. That is, we think that 
the differences between the feature values within the class are smaller than 
the differences out of class. In addition, we have an additional dataset of 
size $M$ of which we do not know their classes. We would like to predict these 
data points classes using our dataset of size $N$ (our training data). Given 
this information, and assuming that our feature dimension $P$ is sufficiently 
small, or we have data size $N >> P$ such that we can overcome the curse of 
dimensionality associated with distance problems, we would like to apply the 
K nearest neighbors classification scheme [2].

\vspace{5 mm}
\noindent
The general idea is we will compare each data point in our classification data 
set to all of the data in our training set. We compute the distance between 
the data we wish to classify and all of the training data. The distance measure 
can be a variety of metrics (e.g. the Euclidean distance, absolute distance, 
some user defined distance metric, etc...). For our purposes, we will use the 
Euclidean distance metric for distances. The $K$ training data points with the 
smallest computed distance are the data points we will classify on. We classify 
the point to one of the $C$ classes that appears the most in the $K$ selected 
training points.

\textbf{Serial Classification - Algorithm}

\vspace{5 mm}
\noindent
We can iterate through each point you would wish to classify, compute its 
distance from every training data point, select the closest $K$ points, and 
return the class that appears the most of those $K$ points. The psuedo code for 
this process is as follows:

        }

\textbf{Serial Classification - Analysis}

\vspace{5 mm}

On a single machine, this algorithm will take $O(N P M \log K)$ because:

\begin{itemize}
\item For each data point we wish to classify, we need to compute a distance 
metric, which will be $O(P)$
\item We do this computation against $N$ data points, so $O(N P)$ for one data 
point to classify.
\item We then need to compare the distance just computed to all other $K$ 
distances cached and insert. This can be done in $O(\log K)$ with a binary 
search. This is done at each computation of a distance, so our running 
complexity so far is $O(N P \log K)$
\item We now need to do this for all of the data we wish to classify, so this 
is in total $O(N P M \log K)$
\end{itemize}

\vspace{5 mm}

\textbf{Distributed Classification - Algorithm}

\vspace{5 mm}
\noindent
We can modify this algorithm to run on a distributed network. The most direct 
method of performing this is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Compute the cross product between the data we wish to classify and our 
training data.
\item Ship the data evenly across all of our machines.
\item Compute the distance between each pair of points locally.
\item Reduce for each data point we wish to classify that data point and the 
$K$ smallest distances, which we then use to predict
\end{itemize}

\vspace{5 mm}
\noindent
Assume we have $S$ machines. The above is easily implemented in a MapReduce 
framework.

\textbf{Distributed Classification - Analysis}

\vspace{5 mm}
\noindent
We will now analyze the time complexity, shuffle size, and communication of
this process. For the mapper, all we are doing is pairing up and duplicating our
data we wish to classify with our training data. Each pairing can be done in
constant time, so the time complexity is proportional to the total data size,
or $O(N M)$. Our shuffle size is also proportional to the amount of data we
produce, which again is $O(N M)$. To distribute our data to all $S$ machines, 
we must perform a one-to-all communication. We cannot avoid not transmitting 
all $O(N M)$ data points, so our cost for communication is $O(N M)$.

\vspace{5 mm}
\noindent
For our reducer's time complexity, we will investigate a single machine. Assume 
we can map data roughly evenly across all $S$ machines, so we have 
$\ceil*{\frac{N M}{S}}$ data on a single machine. Our analysis for the time 
complexity for this process is similar to our sequential analysis:

\begin{itemize}
\item We need to compute a distance for each of our $\ceil*{\frac{N M}{S}}$ 
data points, which will be $O(P \ceil*{\frac{N M}{S}})$ for all of our data on 
a single machine. 
\item The combination step increase our work, but will reduce our communication 
cost (analyzed later). If all same-type keys are on the same machine, this 
step requires appending our data to a single sorted list, which can be done in 
$O(N \log N)$ with a mergesort.
\item When we reduce to one machine, each key will have a list of distance, 
classification tuple pairs of at least $K$ and at most $K S$ if the key was 
distributed across all $S$ machines. If the size is only $K$, we just need to 
compute the mode of the classes, which should be $O(K)$. If not, we need to 
sort the list on our distances first and then compute a mode. Assuming our 
worst case, we can sort the list in $O(K S \log K S)$ with quicksort. 
Performing this for each data point will total $O(M K S \log K S)$ for the 
worst case and $O(M K)$ for the best case.
\item Our total time complexity is then 
$O(P \ceil*{\frac{N M}{S}} + N \log N + M K S \log K S)$
\end{itemize}

\vspace{5 mm}
\noindent
Putting all of our data from our $S$ machines onto one machine will require an 
all to one communication. Based on the above analysis, each machine will have 
to transmit at most $\ceil*{\frac{N M}{S}}$ each, for a total of $O(N M)$ 
communication cost. This corresponds to no combining of data. However, if we do 
combine, the best case would be if all data with the same key is on the same 
machine for all keys. Then we would transmit only one tuple for each key, 
meaning our communication cost would be $O(M)$.

\textbf{Distributed Versus Serial Classification}

\vspace{5 mm}
\noindent
For situations where all of our data can fit on one machine, we want to know 
which methodology performs better. The computational complexity advantage of 
using a distributed cluster is apparent. In serial, our computational 
complexity is $O(N P M \log K)$. In our best case distributed situation (all 
keys on the same machine), the computing complexity is 
$O(P \ceil*{\frac{N M}{S}} + N \log N) = O(N \log N)$ assuming 
$N > P \ceil*{\frac{N M}{S}}$. The ratio of the serial time complexity to the 
distributed complexity is $O(P M \frac{\log K}{\log N})$, meaning we have 
approximately a $O(P M)$ speed up in computational complexity.

\vspace{5 mm}
\noindent
However, to do a thorough analysis, we also need to factor in the communication 
cost. It is worth noting that determining whether it is worth using a 
distributed setup depends on your computing cluster, including how fast of a 
network you have and how many machines you have. Note that we have a shuffle 
size of $O(N M)$ in our map step, which depending on your network can 
eclipse your computational complexity savings \textbf{CITATION???}. During your 
reduce, you could also have another $O(N M)$ data transfer, although optimally 
it will be $O(M)$. These are not trivial communication costs, and deciding if 
to distribute or not will depend on this analysis. \textbf{CITATION}
