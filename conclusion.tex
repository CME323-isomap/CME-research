\section{Conclusion}

\noindent
We have seen two methods of distributing K nearest neighbors. The direct 
approach exhibits rather large communication costs as we need to duplicate our 
data multiple times ($O(N M)$) to implement it. It does, however, have 
reduced complexity; linear in the number of machines that we have.

\noindent
Our second approach is to approximate our K nearest neighbors with hybrid spill 
trees. The exact time complexity and communication cost is highly dependent on 
your data as well as some of your model parameters (namely your resampling 
parameters). Further emperical analysis will need to be completed to flesh out 
how dependent these features are on runtime and communication cost. It should 
be noted, however, that despite these uncertainties you may still have to 
implement your problem in this manner because of your data size. If your data 
is too big to fit on one machine, there is little you can do to avoid high 
communication costs when trying to implement K nearest neighbors on a 
distributed framework.
