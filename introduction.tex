K nearest neighbor is typically applied as a classification method. The 
intuition behind it is given some training data and a new data point, you would 
like to classify the new data based on the class of the training data that it 
is close to. Closeness is defined by a distance metric (e.g. $L_{2}$, $L_{1}$, 
etc...) applied to the feature space. We find the $k$ closest such data points 
across the whole training data and classify based on a majority class of the 
$k$ nearest training data.

The K nearest neighbor method of classification works well when similar classes 
are clustered around certain feature spaces. However, the major downside to 
implementing the K nearest neighbor method is it is computationally intense. 
If we have training data size $N$, feature space size $P$, and neighbor size 
$k$, we need to perform $O(NP)$ computations to determine the
